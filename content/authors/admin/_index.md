I'm currently a PhD student of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University. Before joining Penn State, I completed my Master degree at Purdue University and worked as Research Associate at [Mechanical Engineering Education Research Center](https://www.purdue.edu/meercat/) for one year.

My resaerch interests and experiences are most related to two areas:
Human Factors: cognitive measurements, human-computer interaction and cybersecurity.
Education Innovation: student experience and outcomes and faculty experience in education innovation.
